                    <p>
                        I am passionate about programming. From full stack web development, to making games in GameMaker Studio and Unity, I love the challenges an interesting new project provides. I work well both independently and with a diverse team, and Iâ€™ve worked on projects built from scratch, and ones using an existing code base.
                    </p>

                        I enjoy the fact that you must continually evolve in software development. Whether it be exploring the nooks and crannies of a familiar language, or learning a new one, I strive to write clean, well-documented code.
                    </p>
